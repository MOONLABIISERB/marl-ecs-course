# Assignment 3 - MAPF problem

### Q.1 :
Your aim is to develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy that minimizes the overall
time required for all agents to reach their destinations. Specifically, you should seek to minimize
the maximum time taken by any single agent to reach its goal. You may employ multi-agent
rollouts as part of your approach. Once complete, report the minimum time achieved by your
solution.

- Minimum average time required for all agents to reach there goal : **10 steps** 
  >Here time is calculated as the number of steps required to reach the goal and is equal to the absolute value of the total reward accumulated over an episode by the agent.



### Q.2 BONUS : 
As a bonus challenge, solve the MAPF problem where each agentâ€™s starting position is
randomized for every epoch or episode while all other parameters and conditions remain the
same.
