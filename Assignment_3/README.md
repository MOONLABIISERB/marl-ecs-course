# Assignment 3 - MAPF problem

### Q.1 :
Your aim is to develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning strategy that minimizes the overall
time required for all agents to reach their destinations. Specifically, you should seek to minimize
the maximum time taken by any single agent to reach its goal. You may employ multi-agent
rollouts as part of your approach. Once complete, report the minimum time achieved by your
solution.




### Q.2 BONUS : 
As a bonus challenge, solve the MAPF problem where each agent’s starting position is
randomized for every epoch or episode while all other parameters and conditions remain the
same.
