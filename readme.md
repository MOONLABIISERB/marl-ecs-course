## Question 1

Question 1 involves modelling the college life of a student into a MDP and finding out optimal policies for his actions using value iteration and policy iteration methods.

## Question 2

Question 2 involves solving a grid problem where a robot needs to reach a certain goal position. There are obstructions present in the grid to make the scenario more challenging. Further there the goal position is entirely cutoff from rest of the grid using obstructions, and can only be reached through another grid position that has a teleportation mechanism that directly transports the robot inside the cutoff section with the goal.
Value iteration and Policy iteration methods were used to find the optimal policies and the results obtained are:
