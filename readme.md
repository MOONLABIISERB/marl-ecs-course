## Question 1

Question 1 involves modelling the college life of a student into a MDP and finding out optimal policies for his actions using value iteration and policy iteration methods.

The results from both Value Iteration and Policy Iteration are consistent. Both methods produce nearly identical value functions and the same optimal policy. The optimal actions are: Eat_Food in the Hostel and when Hungry. Attend_Class in the Academic Building and Canteen. This consistency indicates that both algorithms have successfully identified the optimal policy for the studentâ€™s task, validating the MDP solution.

## Question 2

Question 2 involves solving a grid problem where a robot needs to reach a certain goal position. There are obstructions present in the grid to make the scenario more challenging. Further there the goal position is entirely cutoff from rest of the grid using obstructions, and can only be reached through another grid position that has a teleportation mechanism that directly transports the robot inside the cutoff section with the goal.
Value iteration and Policy iteration methods were used to find the optimal policies and the results obtained are:
