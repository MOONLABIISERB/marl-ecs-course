#### Project report has name "MARLProject_21008"

#### Objective
The goal of this project was for two agents to collaborate in moving requested shelves containing goods to
 goal positions and then returning the shelves to empty spots. The agents were required to minimize time
 and collisions in a 2D grid world while avoiding obstacles, which included non-requested shelves and the
 other agent.
