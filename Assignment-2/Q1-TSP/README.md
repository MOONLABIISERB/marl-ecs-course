### Performance Comparison

| Solver                          | Average Return  |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Dynamic Programming              | -59.1517        |
| Monte Carlo                     | -61.8428        |
| Monte Carlo Epsilon-Greedy      | -64.5150        |

## Conclusion

The results indicate the performance of each solver:

- **Dynamic Programming** achieved the best average return, indicating the shortest path on average.
- **Monte Carlo Methods** performed slightly worse but provided reasonable solutions.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration** resulted in a higher average total reward compared to the other methods, suggesting that the added exploration did not significantly improve the solution quality in this case.
