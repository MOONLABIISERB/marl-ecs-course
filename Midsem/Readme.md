**Convergence:** Starting around episode 1500, the agent consistently collects a total reward of approximately 145.31, indicating the agent has likely converged to an optimal policy.

**Initial High Variability:** Early episodes show significant variability in rewards, with some episodes having highly negative rewards (e.g., -79977 and -19863). This suggests that the agent was initially exploring and learning, sometimes revisiting targets, which incurs heavy penalties.

**Stable Performance:** After convergence, the rewards remain constant at 145.31, suggesting that the agent has learned a stable policy and is performing consistently well by avoiding penalties.

**Negative Rewards in Some Episodes:** There are sporadic episodes with significant negative rewards (e.g., Episode 600: -9860). This could be due to revisiting targets in those particular episodes, causing the penalty.
