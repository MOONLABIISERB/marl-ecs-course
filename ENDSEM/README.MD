# Mini Football

## Problem Statement

● To develop and optimize a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policy for playing mini football.
● Challenges
    ○ Cooperative & Competitive Strategies: To make the agents cooperatively and competitively learn
      strategies to score goals, dribble, pass, defence, and adapting to the actions of the opponent.
○ Individual and Collective Learning: Each agent should learn to control the ball individually and also
coordinate with teammates to keep possession of the ball with its own team.
○ Continuous State Space: Agents must learn from an infinite possibilities of positions, velocities, and
orientations on the field. It is difficult to map each combination of state variables to a particular
optimal action.

● We aim to create autonomous players (agents) that can learn complex behaviours such as teamwork,
strategy, and optimal decision-making in dynamic, rapidly changing environments.
