# Key Differences Between Value Iteration and Monte Carlo

Learning Methodology:

Value Iteration: Uses a deterministic approach, updating state values iteratively based on expected future rewards.
Monte Carlo: Relies on sampling complete episodes, updating values based on actual returns received.

Updates and Convergence:

Value Iteration: Converges systematically in finite iterations; updates all states simultaneously.
Monte Carlo: Convergence can be slower and more variable; updates based on complete episode returns.

Environment Knowledge:

Value Iteration: Requires knowledge of transition probabilities and rewards (model-based).
Monte Carlo: Does not require knowledge of the environment's dynamics (model-free).

Applicability:

Value Iteration: Suitable for smaller, known state spaces and deterministic environments.
Monte Carlo: Effective for larger, complex, or stochastic environments.
